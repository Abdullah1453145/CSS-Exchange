# About ExPerfWiz
ExPerfWiz is a PowerShell based script to help automate the collection of performance data on Exchange 2013, 2016 and 2019 servers.Â  Supported operating systems are Windows 2012, 2012 R2, 2016 and 2019 Core and Standard.

# Initial Run
Run .\ExPerfWiz.ps1 from an elevated shell.

* You will be prompted to setup a default collector on the current server.
* Selecting Y will configure but not start a default collector on the current server.
* Selecting N will return to a prompt without creating a collector.

Once a prompt is returned all of the ExPerfWiz functions will now be available to run.

# Example Usage

### Default usage for data gathering

### Stop Data Collection

  `Stop-ExPerfwiz`

### Collect data from another server

  `New-ExPerfwiz -FolderPath C:\experfwiz -server RemoteExchServer`

### Collect data from multiple servers

`Get-ExchangeServer | Foreach {New-Experfwiz -folderpath C:\experfwiz -startoncreate -Server $_.name}`

# Important Notes
* The default duration is 8 hours to save on disk space meaning that the data collection will stop after 8 hours.
* Using -Threads should only be done if needed to troubleshoot the issue.  It will SIGNIFICANTLY increase the size of the resulting perfmon files.
* Do not stop the log gathering thru the Perfmon GUI that can result in an unreadable log file.  Always stop the data gathering with Stop-Experfwiz.
